# Portfolio
In today's digital age, a personal portfolio website serves as a professional’s digital identity, helping them showcase their skills, work, and experiences to potential employers, collaborators, and clients. This project aims to design and develop a personal portfolio website using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio is structured into various sections—Home, About, Projects, Skills, Works and Contact—to give a comprehensive overview of the individual’s professional background, technical expertise, and key accomplishments. The website is designed with a responsive layout to ensure compatibility across multiple devices and browsers, making it easily accessible and user-friendly.
